    <h3 id="why-javascript">Why Javascript?</h3>

<p>Javascript was created in just 10 days. It’s unique in that way as most languages have an incubation time in a lab where much troubleshooting and bug-fixing occurs. Javascript did not. It came out like a quick and dynamic but untrained boxer, flashy and competent but riddled with flaws; and as a result, it took many years and <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webed/wiki/A_Short_History_of_JavaScript">many shots</a> to become the favored contender that it is today.</p>

<p>It was created by Brendan Eich, and today It’s a trademark of the Oracle Corporation; but like that ambitious and restless boxer, Javascript has been funneled through a labyrinth of gyms and trainers on its way up. It’s been layered with capabilities and components as a result.</p>

<figure>

  <figcaption>The imperfect separator does the work of separating statements in Javascript.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It was born in 1995, but its upward momentum was somewhat thwarted by <a href="http://webaim.org/blog/user-agent-string-history/">the great browser wars</a> of the late 90’s and early millenium. It did appreciate with some cyclical standardization, and then in 2005, Javascript got a major foothold. A guy named Jesse James Garret released a series of technologies for which Javascript was the backbone. Its relevancy went suddenly and exponentially fertile.</p>

<p>Needless to say, it hasn’t always been loved by all, and It’s not all to be loved. After all, it hasn’t shed all those nasty habits from its street-fighting days. One JS expert, <a href="http://it-ebooks.info/book/274/">Douglas Crockford</a> had this to say about the language in its totality:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>some of those features were more trouble than they were worth. Some of them were poorly specified… more likely to cause portability problems. Some resulted in code that was difficult ot read or modify. Some induced me to write in a manner that was too tricky and error-prone. And some of those features were design errors. Sometimes language designers make mistakes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Today, Javascript continues to grow in dynamism and power. When learning it, It’s important to focus on what it does well. So, why use it? The reasons are multifold: </p>
<ul>
     <li>It's easy to learn.</li>
     <li>It's simple and accessible to edit. You don't need any fancy software to make it happen.</li>
     <li>It makes use of prototyping. Any object can be created for any situation, and they all inherit properties of the object protoype. This allows for a ton of flexibility.</li>
     <li>Web development tools are set up to use Javascript. this = simplicity.</li>
     <li>Ajax. This is what makes Javascript work without a page reload.</li>
     <li>HTML5 is like Javascript's longtime sparring partner; they've been designed to understand one another.</li>
     <li>It's <a href="http://nodejs.org/">ever-evolving</a>.</li>
   </ul>

    <h3 id="abstract-sequential-meets-concrete-random">Abstract Sequential Meets Concrete Random</h3>

<p>In retrospect, my two dominant thinking styles are pretty clearly demarcated. In the past I’ve attributed this to being a Gemini, so I’m glad to finally have a more academically-reinforced reason for my volatility. I’d say I’ve tended mostly to volley between the two, but seeing them laid out all table-bound, I’m realizing the potential in synthesizing them as well.</p>

<p>I’m a close split between Concrete Random and Abstract Sequential, which by definition, includes both polarity as well as some crossover. I like experimenting and using my intuition as much as I like to analyze and apply logic. Sometimes this pairing has proven contradictory or mutually exclusive, and at other times, it’s been alchemical. I do like to jump into something head-first, sometimes before I fully understand it; but I’m also incredibly uncomfortable with this inclination and will often pull back and try to force out a plan of action. I like trial and error as much as I like access to and info from more informed mentors, and I thrive on competition just as much as I like to work in complete isolation for days on end.</p>

<p>What I’ve gathered about my learning from this look at my two styles is that I need to be careful about one style canceling out the vitality of the other. I know when I get fascist about a plan of action, my Abstract Sequential self wants the disruptive, risk-taking Concrete Random self to stick to the logic. I also know that the CR will trial and error himself into a frenzy while the AS is happy to ask for some guidance or to consult a tutorial. </p>

<figure>
  <img src="/images/learn_style.png" alt="" />
  <figcaption>Synthesizing styles can be very enriching.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I think it would behoove me to allow a little more dialogue between these two: to lean toward their collaboration rather than their conflict. I think it boils down to change and agility. There’s a huge potential benefit from having different styles and outlets. Allowing myself to change things up, to pull in a player off the bench, to mix and match, to let one style take precedence when a situation calls for it, and to avoid defaulting to habit could all really improve my learning and my efficiency. This is where my <a href="http://mindsetonline.com/changeyourmindset/firststeps/">mindset</a> must come into play. The contradiction that arises from these two learning styles has been largely a result of a fixed mindset, of a first thought is last chance kind of rationalizing. With the development of a more sophisticated growth mindset, I think my two learning styles can be integrated and mutually beneficial rather than primarily adverse.</p>

<p>Also, I’m trying to pay close attention to where these two styles cross over. It seems they both thrive on working through problems alone, so I have to continue to give myself ample solitude to really synthesize the concepts I’m learning. Both styles also have a tough time with too much routine and rule restrictions. Keeping a regimen that allows for innovation and exploration will be one of my greatest challenges, but it should also prove to be very rewarding.</p>

  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Positioning elements on the page has everything to do with how the user experiences the space they’ve entered. It gives developers the opportunity, to some degree, to guide the user down a particular route. It can influence where one is likely to first direct their attention and where one is likely to end up. Positioning can also point toward what a user might end up feeling is the single most important takeaway from their interaction with the page or application.</p>

<p>There are four types of positioning, and the following is a brief description of the powers each one harnesses. Pay extra close attention to how each interacts with the left/right/bottom/top properties. These interactions demonstrate how these positionings can be useful.</p>

<h3 id="static">Static</h3>

<p>Static positioning is the default. Without explicit definition, all elements are static. They sit in whatever way the cascade of the page dictates. Static elements don’t care about top/bottom/left/right properties. Adding one of these will do nothing to a static element.</p>

<h3 id="relative">Relative</h3>

<p>Relative positioning has a tricky name. It might seem like it’s measured “relative to” something else, but in fact, it’s measured relative to itself, specifically to where it would normally be on the page. This is where the left/right/bottom/top properties become so useful. They tell the relative-positioned element how far and in what direction from its origin to move. These have a special relationship with the next type: absolute. Relatives are often used as parents for absolute-positioned elements. Relative parent elements can be thought of the “relative” that gave “absolutely” everything to its child. </p>

<figure>
  <img src="/images/positions.png" />
  <figcaption><a href="http://cssdog.com/css_tricks.html" title="The Absolute-Relative Relationship">The Absolute-Relative Relationship</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="absolute">Absolute</h3>

<p>Absolute elements are like the grandchildren of normal flow in that they tend to be once-removed from it. An absolute-positioned element is relative to the next closest parent that isn’t positioned as static. Top/bottom/left/right properties will move an absolute element in relation to where it is within that parent and not in relation to its own place on the page. This positioning is uniquely useful because it allows overlapping of other elements. When several siblings are all positioned absolute, a z-index assignment will give them a stacking order for overlap.</p>

</figure>

<h3 id="fixed">Fixed</h3>

<p>No amount of scrolling in the browser window will move a fixed element. It’s stuck. It’s the reject element in the normal flow; all the other elements ignore it and act like it doesn’t exist. The stubborn fixed element doesn’t care though. It stays right where the top/bottom/left/right properies set it, and it overlaps anything flowing under it in body of the document.</p>

    <h3 id="pitchforktv">Pitchfork.tv</h3>

<p>I’ve been a longtime visitor to Pitchfork for the music. It’s consistently a great place to find new music, but only recently has it also become a better site to be on as well. It used to be kind of a mess, with unclear navigation and a disorganized collage. The newer version is perfectly set up for what the site is best for: discovering music. It’s still not the greatest looking site in my opinion. I’m not a huge fan of the all-black background and overall heaviness. I like it’s use of the gallery a lot though; it streamlines and seems to set everything equally so the user’s eye can be drawn toward the aesthetic that tends to match individual musical preference. The featured video is obviously where the eye is immediately drawn, which creates a powerful minimalism for the front page (and other pages too), is ever-changing and, as a result, an attraction. The site also does a great job of understating the excessive numbers of pages it contains with the gray tabs and tiny font. I generally walk away from Pitchfork having found something new,  and feeling like there’s a lot of great music in the world and not enough time to enjoy all of it.</p>

<h3 id="scribd">Scribd.</h3>

<p>Scribd. calls itself the Netflix of books, and it’s getting closer to living up to that title. When I first started using the site, it was a cluttered collection of academic papers with a million ads, but it’s successfully evolved into something definitely more elegant and definitely more Netflixesque. It bookmarks where a user’s at with each item viewed, and it gives some excellent suggestions based on past reads. I continue to find stuff on there that I haven’t found anywhere else online alongside bestsellers. Unfortunately, it’s a paid site, so when you first get there, you get asked for money or a free month trial. Had I not enjoyed its perks when it was free, this would be a deal breaker. Once logged in, my attention is usually pulled into the recommendation sections, and if I don’t get sucked into one of these,  then I end up circling up toward the icons that show where I left off in past reads. I like that it’s equally easy to get lost down a trail of suggestions as it is to search its trove for obscure papers on whatever. I generally leave the site feeling inspired.</p>

<h3 id="ubuweb">Ubuweb</h3>

<p>Ubuweb is compact, dense, content heavy, and intense. I love it because it manages to maintain minimilism in an unorthodox sort of way. It uses incredibly tiny font and a lot of white space. The top header on each page is usually cryptic and creepy and, like the rest of the design, doesn’t take away from the content. The site is very light on design which lets the content stand out. And the content is really remarkable. It’s a giant archive of rarely found audio material, poetry, and some visual representations as well. It’s a unique site, one that took me more than one visit to fall in love with. The design makes it feel like mining for a treasure rather than being handed one. </p>

    <h2 id="thoughts-on-fireside">Thoughts on Fireside</h2>

<p>I feel honored to be part of an educational experiment like Dev Boocamp. The day I started Phase 0, Dev announced their acquisition by Kaplan. To me this signals that DBC has brought their experiment with learning and teaching to a pinnacle that that has peaked the interest of scholars and others invested in the learning process worldwide. That’s an exciting place and time in which to be joining. That said, I’m pretty terrified. This program seems to ask not just for a ton of learning, but for a change in the way I think about learning: a huge and humbling change to undertake. </p>

<p>One of the most invigorating takeaways from the fireside video was Shereef’s description of the “creator” versus the “entitlement” mindset. It seems like traditional education models definitely reinforce the entitlement mode of being. I have a Master’s degree, and I know from spending large amounts of time with them that the academics’ mindset can definitely foster entitlement and that “restaurant” attitude. I’m thrilled to be walking into an alternative to that. The “kitchen” perspective is definitely a mode of engagement that I’d like to be able to contribute to both my job and my personal life.</p>
