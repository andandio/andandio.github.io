    <h2 id="how-to-ask-a-good-question">How to Ask a Good Question</h2>

<p>This is a great topic to write about because, historically, I’ve been a pretty terrible question asker. For a long time, I allowed myself to believe that asking questions (to another person) somehow indicates a kind of weakness, so I didn’t practice it much. </p>

<p>I’m a much better question asker on the Internet, probably because the best asked questions of search engines are those asked in caveman syntax. The fewer, more important words, the better. Talking with real live people involves a higher, more sophisticated synthesis of nonverbal cues, body language, eye contact, preparation, and articulation. </p>

<p>So, now I look to the Internet for help with asking questions of other humans. Here’s what the Internet answers:</p>

<h3 id="know-what-youre-looking-for">Know what you’re Looking for.</h3>

<p>A good question has an end in site; it’s not characterized by a “please tell me the history of the world” sort of open-endedness. It’s as precise as it hopes its answer to be. That said, don’t ask yes or no questions. Maybe thinking like a reporter would be a good goal for this one. Ask for nouns and verbs, very specific ones.</p>

<h3 id="use-follow-up-questions">Use Follow Up Questions.</h3>

<p>Learning to code has definitely honed my skills in this area. Rarely, have I had my questions answered in a single response regarding coding. I’ve learned that I have to take the pieces that come to me and look further down the road toward where they point. There’s a certain endurance involved with follow-up questions that I was complete wimp at before I started coding. Coding has taught me (across all topics) to ask early, ask often, ask again, rephrase, ask more. </p>

<h3 id="accepting-the-response">Accepting the Response.</h3>

<p>There’s power in silence, especially when it’s being used to formulate an accurate exchange. When a question is asked, it’s good to give the asked a chance to answer. Not interupting would definitely be filed here too. Even if, in asking the question, the answer comes automatically, it’s good to hold out for the person asked; they might have an even greater answer in store.</p>

<h3 id="ask-the-right-person">Ask the Right Person.</h3>
<p>My girlfriend answers and asks questions for a living, so I thought I’d ask her what she would say is most important about asking questions. I was expecting her focus to be like mine, to be something that the asker does to prepare their statement. Her answer, however, had more to do with the person who’s being asked. She said she thinks it’s important to make sure the person addressed is receptive to being engaged, to read their body language before asking the question, and to know your source.The Internet agrees. You don’t want to ask a four-year old for instructions on turning off your gas main. Know who you’re talking to and adress an appropriate person for the topic. </p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <h3 id="statically-typed-versus-dynamically-typed-how-languages-shift">Statically Typed versus Dynamically Typed, how Languages Shift</h3>

<p>The primary difference between static and dynamic computer languages is that in static languages, a variable must be declared as a type before it can be used in the code. These types include String, integer, float, array, etc. In a dynamic language, once the type is determined, the variable cannot change into something else (except with parsing and a few other tricks), and it must abide by the rules its type determines.</p>

<p>The line of judement occurs when the code is compiled. In statically typed languages, this can be helpful because bugs can be located and squashed earlier. In Dynamic languages, errors don’t pop up until run time, and can as a result, be a little trickier to try to unpack.  </p>

<p>One thing that can help developers who work in Dynamic languages is the implementation of test code to find those bugs earlier while still enjoying the freedom of not having to declare a variable type for every variable instantiation.  </p>

<p>So, what is Ruby? Ruby is a dynamically typed language because you can change the variable type within a program, and you don’t have to determine what kind of variable you’re initiating.</p>

<p>It’s easy to confuse the terms strongly and weakly typed languages with dynamic and static. Don’t be fooled; they aren’t the same even though they’re very similar. Although strong and static have some crossover, Ruby is actually both a dynamically and a strongly typed language. These might seem like opposites, but they really aren’t. The trick is that once a program knows what type it’s dealing with, it wants its methods to match it. That’s what makes Ruby strongly typed. Javascript is another dynamically typed language, but it happens to be also characterized as weakly typed. You can mix and match types in expressions as well as swap their type out whenever you want. </p>

    <p>Query optimization is an automated process that finds the most efficient way to return on a user’s query. This can be quite a complex operation with many possible routes to completion, so optimization tries to do the task in the most time-efficient manner possible.</p>

<p>One of the most important ways the optimizer works is by using a 3-part algorithm that relies heavily on join order and sort order. The algorithm’s pseudocode reads a bit like comparison shopping ($ = time); I’ll try to explain the basics of it here:&lt;</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Maps all possible routes between the queried relationship.  It also looks at the cheapest route for returning things in a particular sorted order.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Goes back and checks on connections made with the JOIN keyword. As with the first step, it will figure out the cheapest way to join the relation pairs, followed by doing the same thing with a sort order in mind.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once these two-relation blueprints are created, the third (or more relations) in the query can be computed with an additional join. </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The human element in this can play a big role in helping the query optimization pick the best route of extraction. Of course, I don’t yet know from experience what truly works best, but from the wise words of the Internet, here are some suggestions for helping the optimizer along. (Please leave me a comment if you disagree with any of these!)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Minimize subquery blocks</li>

  <li>IN is preferable when the query is weighted in the subquery while EXISTS speeds things up when the bulk of criteria is in the main query.</li>

  <li>Performing sort order earlier can reduce repetitive sorting later and can also make a later join smoother by clustering before joining huge chunks of data.</li>

  <li>In joins focused on one-to-many relationship, use EXISTS instead of DINSTINCT.</li>

  <li>Adding keys when creating tables can speed the first step in the algorithm along by adding more potential connections for the optimizer to choose from.</li>

  <li>Start all SQL verbs on a new line.</li>

  <li>Consider reorganizing your database schema. You may have some extra
  baggage in there somewhere.</li>

  <li>Only query what you need. The more you ask for, the more expensive the result. Along those same lines, using "*" is slower than specifying columns.</li>

  <li>Always try to JOIN on indexed fields.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many more suggestions out there, but I’ve limited this post to the commands I have a handle on. Optimizing is a bit sophisticated for my skill level, but it’s great to be thinking about higher levels of organization and syntax as we go deeper into our learning. In general, expect your queries to be really fast. If they’re taking longer than 1 second, you can probably optimize. &lt;</p>

    <h2 id="a-focus-on-values--how-they-light-up-the-path">A Focus on Values &amp; how they Light Up the Path</h2>

<h3 id="first-things-first">First things First</h3>

<p>The last few years have been an exponential lesson in attention to values. I’ve spent some time futzing around outside of my value set – clearing the value palate, you could say – and I’ve spent a lot more time meditating on what values I actually do want to hold as a guide. Of course, it’s probably best to have a fine blend of values; but as for the value torch, I’d have to go with integrity. It could be argued that there are seasons for just about everything else: ambition, creativity, challenge, serenity, even honesty. Integrity, though, is something to me that’s less of a morality marker and more of a foundation, something that sets the alignment for all other values. By definition, it’s the state of being whole. It’s been the one thing that when I’ve consistently struck it, regardless of the circumstances, everything else falls into place.</p>

<h3 id="advice-is-a-pointer">Advice is a Pointer</h3>

<p>The advice prompt for this post strikes me as a pointer toward what the world values in me, or what values I project out into my community. My partner writes two weekly columns for San Francisco publications, and she asks me every week for editorial advice. I get this request from many different people in my circles, and it’s definitely indicative of where I’ve pointed my attention and to which values I’ve attended up to this point in my life.</p>

<h3 id="not-all-values-all-the-time">Not all Values all the Time</h3>

<p>I know that some of the values that I would rate as very strong for me may not always serve me well in every situation, especially in the face of stereotype threat. When I lean on challenge, adventure, ambition, and willpower, I may not respond as well to stereotype threat (I might actually reinforce the stereotype) as I would when I press further into serenity, compassion, vibrancy, and truth. The key here, again, is integrity, or knowing what combination of values will make me whole in any given moment. I think an important addition to this would be the word “agile”. Having agile integrity is important in knowing when to lean on certain values and when to back off of others. </p>

    <h2 id="class-methods">Class Methods</h2>

<p>By now, instance methods are becoming fairly regular, maybe even automatic in our Ruby development.  What about class methods though? What are they good for and when might we use them?</p>

<p>There’s a lot of chatter out there among Rubyists about the use of class methods, but one thing seems to be largely agreed upon; class methods, as a general rule, should be used sparingly and only when absolutely necessary. </p>

<p>Class methods exist in a global state, in the context of the arguments they receive, and they can be accessed and called from anywhere. They hold a different perspective altogether from methods of object instance, which reside not just in the context of arguments but also in the state of the specific object they are called upon. In this comparison, class methods are actually closer to procedural programming (from which our increasing sophistication pulls us further away) than they are to object-oriented programming. Class methods aren’t tied in the same way to the goings-on of a specific object (even though classes ARE objects – a chicken/egg creation riddle we won’t solve here). </p>

<p>As we’ve already seen with global variables, anything global is most often going to be less effective.  If our goal is to keep our programs, and by design, our classes more modular for easier reuse and expansion, then fewer pervasive design qualities should bring us closer to that goal. Referring to instances of objects is preferable to referring to the class as a whole. </p>

<p>Sometimes, though, it isn’t practical to refer to a function at the instance level. We might want to execute something that isn’t or can’t be tied to a particular object. Our virus predictor challenge held one example. The program was set up to create reports for individual state objects, but then we were asked to create a report for all 50 states. One possible solution was to use a class method. The VirusPredictor class itself could call that nation-wide method because it wouldn’t make sense for an individual state object to call a report for the entire country. </p>

<figure>
  <img src="/images/vp.jpg.png" alt="virus predictor example" />
  <figcaption>Virus Predictor example.</figcaption> 
</figure>
<p>What are some other possible examples of good use of class methods? One is the necessity to execute a function before an object is ever instantiated. A more specific example would be that of a user setting up a new account; no instance of the user class has been created so we could let the class do the work itself. This is characteristic of any example in which there is no specific context for the function, so the class has to be assigned the work. We might need a sum of all of the objects in our class, or an average age of all our objects. In fact, the Math Class itself is a great example of the necessity of class methods at play. We’ve seen and used a wide range of class methods for arrays, strings, hashes, etc.; but this post focuses more on class methods that we write into our own classes. </p>

<p>What are these programmer-created classes supposed to look like? There are three stylistic choices out there that all have slightly different functioning preferences. </p>

<p>Option 1
 self.bar</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/images/self.jpg.png" alt="self for class method" />
  <figcaption> Self for class method</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Using the “self” keyword to identify a class method as something other than an instance is one solution. It’s simple and appears to be an often-preferred one from the empirical evidence online. It’s a clear-cut way to denote a single class method among a bunch of instance methods in a class. 
Option 2
bar « self</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/images/shovelself.jpg.png" alt="shovel class method" />
  <figcaption> Shovel Class Method</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This syntax works best when setting a group of class methods to a singular block.  In theory it’s more organized than the use of  “self” above, with which you’d need to look through all the code to find other potential class methods.  The « self style is also reportedly used more for metaprogramming (where you’d want self to be set for more than a single method), which is definitely not a topic for this blog post.</p>

<p>Option 3
Class_name.bar</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/images/foobar.jpg.png" alt="class name dot method" />
  <figcaption> Class Name dot method</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is my favorite way to denote a class method. It’s clear and there’s no figuring out what “self” of the moment is calling the method as in option 1. It doesn’t seem to be the Rubyist favorite, however, so I look forward to learning more about why that is. </p>

<p>Choosing syntax for a class method is in the end a subjective decision that may be best determined by readability and function in context. It’s important to remember that class methods don’t have access to instance methods or variables, but instance methods can access both class methods and variables. The flexibility and modularity of the instance method makes it the better choice most of the time.  The <a href="http://blog.codeclimate.com/blog/2012/11/14/why-ruby-class-methods-resist-refactoring/">Code Climate blog</a> offers one of the more articulate descriptions for why it’s rare that a class method is the right decision to make:</p>

<p>”…You can’t easily swap in a new class, but you can easily swap in a new instance. This encourages building up additional behavior with composition, rather than needing to re-open and expand classes for every change.”</p>
