  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Listening to Dr. Claude Steele deliver his data on stereotype threat sent a line of a famous Romantic poet shooting through my mind. I had to go look it up to remember it exactly, but it ended up being a line from William Wordsworth from a poem with a title too long and too boring to include here. The line though, is a telling one; it goes: “…of eye, and ear, –both what they half create, /and what perceive;… “</p>

<p>Snooze, you might be thinking. But, wait, the point is not to lull you to sleep with iambic pentameter before the good part of this blog. It’s to suggest that human wiring for reality is and has been for a long time an entwined mess of the projected self and the perceived self.  Everyone has some ratio of it; we half create and half perceive (not usually a 50/50 split). No one is fully in control of how they come across in the world. Unfortunately, as a result we get stereotyped.  We get lumped together. We get something else that came out of Wordsworth’s era, a category and a label.</p>

<p>It was really fascinating to hear what Steele’s studies uncovered about the impact of identity threat. There seems to be a wild paradox in his data: an individual ends up gripping (or being gripped by) an identity that is under threat. Someone who is the only one of something in a room feels the weight of that identity more, and the stereotype can become relevant in the mind of that individual to the point that they fear reinforcing it. The fact that this can lead to failure and subpar performance is testament to the complexity of the human mind. The part of the individual that threatens them the most is that which they are both more likely to protect and that they also want to set free from oppressive societal misconceptions. In essence, under pressure we can end up taking on other’s perceptions of us in an attempt to escape other’s perceptions of us. </p>

<p>The outcome of his research consistently spanned many different race and gender groups. Stereotype threat is a very real and powerful thing that, while always uncomfortable, seems to be exponentially powerful under the push of heavy loads of prejudice and discrimination.  </p>

<p>So how to address these threats in the workplace, especially in a sector so notoriously intent on homogeneity? I think it’s important to be vocal and respectful and to also give people the space to feel uncomfortable. Talking to people and being vulnerable is a great start. </p>

<p>Stereotype threat has impacted me in powerful ways, but I don’t think focusing on what threatens my identity as a straight, white male is an important focus. I think for people like me, who don’t visibly reside in marginalized territory, it’s more important to focus on identifying those stereotypes, fueled by prejudice and discrimination, which have benefitted me at the expense of others. I feel like these, marked by language and attitude, are the pressure points at which real change can be exacted. </p>

    <h2 id="how-classes-can-model-real-world-objects">How Classes can Model Real World Objects</h2>

<p>Classes and Data Structures can easily be used to model real-world objects.  Classes are, by definition, first-class objects. They are open-ended, so by design they are breathable like real-world objects. They can have elements added to them in order
to match changing technologies, or other structures, or business needs. They can grow and shrink. </p>

<p>Naming is an important element in modeling real-world objects. We can literally give objects a cyborg-stye reality by naming them and their functions and characteristics – or attributes – in classes.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of how a class can model the planning and construction of a house. There are a limited number of style options for this program. It’s just a simple example, but hopefully it illustrates the point: classes can mimic the world around us.</p>

<figure>
	<img src="/images/code1.jpg.png" alt="" />
</figure>

<p>You can see that the HouseBuilder object initializes much like the origin of a plan for an actual house, with arguments for the desired square footage as well as the style of house desired. </p>

<p>Each Housebuilder object stores instance variables to hold those details that are intrinsic to its design. We want each method in the class to do only one thing ideally so that the program is as modular as possible. In other words, we want to be able to break a part of the class off with as little possible chance of breaking the whole thing as we can. </p>

<p>Now that we have the basics stored in the HouseBuilder object, we want to create the floorplan.  This will store the basic components of the house object in more instance variables.  In a refactor of this class, each of the instance variables stored in the floorplan could be expanded into subclasses all their own. A “beds” (bedroom) could be a subclass that inherits from a HouseBuilder and defines its own methods, like fenestration or flooring.  For this example though, we’ll leave things a little simpler.</p>

<figure>
	<img src="/images/floorplan.jpg.png" alt="" />
</figure>

<p>At the top of the class, you’ll see that another file is required here, the ‘HOUSE_TYPES’ file&lt;. I used this file to do all the work of storing the details for different styles of houses. That way, when it gets called to action in #features method, it can simply send a report back on design features for the desired type of house that’s been assigned to our HouseBuilder object.
Finally, we get the compiled plan for our new house in the #build_house method.  Check out the magic.</p>

<figure>
	<img src="/images/reqrel.jpg.png" alt="" />
</figure>

<figure>
	<img src="/images/driver_term.jpg.png" alt="" />
</figure>

<p>But wait! There’s more!  What’s our object doing in line 87 of the driver test code? it’s calling a method that isn’t in our class. This method belongs to a module that we included in our class. This is an important (and sneaky) way in which Ruby allows us to use multiple chains of inheritance. We include a module with methods not specific to our object but that our object is allowed to call. This one takes a pair of coordinate points and tells us in what neighborhood in San Francisco our house will be situated. This method potentially works better as a module because it’s not quite inside the realm of a house’s construction, but it’s also an important external component to consider. What’s that? A mirror of real life, right? </p>

    <h2 id="the-exponential-learning-in-peer-pairing">The Exponential Learning in Peer Pairing</h2>

<p>I have peer pairing anxiety.</p>

<p>Whenever the hour comes, and Google sends me that dreaded message that it’s almost time to put on my headphones and talk to a stranger through my computer screen, it’s not excitement that I feel. I start sweating.  A lot. In fact, the other day, my girlfriend asked me why I was wearing a wet t-shirt. </p>

<p>“I just got done with a peer pairing,”” I responded. </p>

<p>I love solitude, and when I started learning and loving to write code, I thought, yes, I finally have an excuse to spend all the time in the world inside my own head. Well, now it turns out that working with another person and, more importantly, being able to articulate my thoughts to a peer on a project are some of the most important skills I can develop in this apprenticeship-like program at DBC. The anxiety around pairing is simply a pointer toward where I can develop myself, so I guess I’m starting to appreciate it as such.</p>

<p>I also wasn’t expecting the goldmine that peer pairing turns out to be. My learning has grown exponentially from peer pairing. I’ve had the realization that while the rate at which I learn independently might generate competence, the rate at which I learn from others has the potential to create excellence. Learning tricks from everyone = way more tricks.</p>

<p>So, I’m really into it even though it makes me uncomfortable. </p>

<p>The coupling of peer pairing and the feedback system seems like a biceps/triceps kind of relationship. Without one, the strength of the other would be far less pronounced. Feedback has had the effect of controlling my momentum in order that I don’t punch myself in the face, so to speak. Also, I feel like if I only received feedback on the work I did, I’d have no opportunity to address the way my thought processes restrict the flexibility of my thinking.</p>

<p>I like the fact that it’s anonymous, or pseudo-anonymous. (It’s not that difficult to figure out who said what.) Not everyone can say exactly what they’re thinking in person, and not everyone knows exactly what they think about an interaction until they’ve had time to think about it. In general, it seems like the percent honesty goes way up when there’s an option to write an anonymous note. For me, I like to go back to working independently after a peer session and see just how a pairing has impacted my thinking before I give feedback. </p>

<p>Someone left me a piece of feedback the other day suggesting that I develop myself in this one particular way. I felt a range of emotions that came with thoughts like “inadequate” and “incompetent”. But then my competitive side took over, and I thought, no way am I going to get that feedback again, and so I spent an hour or so researching and practicing the suggestion.  What happened was inexplicable:  everything changed, even things seemingly unrelated. The way I approached challenges, even the way I thought about pseudocode, was totally different than it had been before. The feedback wasn’t about skill; it was just about the taking of steps. It made such a weird, huge difference that I’m really grateful for it and have since been hoping for more of the actionable stuff. </p>

    <h2 id="looping-is-a-miracle">Looping is a Miracle</h2>

<p>Not really, but loops are an import part of getting computers to do all of human’s boring shit.  Computers don’t get bored of looping or repetition; in fact, they’ll do it forever if you’re not careful. </p>

<p>There are several different ways to loop in Ruby. Each is useful, but more importantly, each of them is useful in different scenarios. Some methods that do the work of a loop don’t actually look like loops at all. Here’s a brief description of the different ways to iterate through a collection of data.</p>

<h3 id="for-loop">For Loop</h3>
<p>It seems the for loop, while popular in other languages, is not usually at the top of a Rubyist’s preference list. There are too many better alternatives. Rarely is a for-loop the most economic way to express a series of iterations, but here it is anyway:</p>

<p>for i in 0…number_of_loops do </p>

<p>and then the action follows and follows and follows.</p>

<h3 id="just-do-it-loop">Just Do It Loop</h3>
<p>A better way to do the for-loop in Ruby is to say “do it”, so here’s that:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>(0..number_of_loops).times do</td>
      <td>i</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Remember, loops of this type and the last type have to be followed by the key word “end”. The “times” here lets the computer know how many times you want the loop to happen.</p>

<h3 id="while-loop">While Loop</h3>
<p>“While” works like “for” except for the fact that it passes a Boolean into the equation. As long as the Boolean tests true, we keep the loop spinning. Make sure and tack an “end” onto this after your instructions, or you’ll have problems.</p>

<p>while x &gt; 0 </p>

<p>get shit done, etc.</p>

<h3 id="until">Until</h3>

<p>“Until” utilizes a Boolean as well. Everything keeps happening until that Boolean turns true. So, the “until” loop needs things to be false in order to keep on looping, and it also needs an “end” after the action.</p>

<p>until x &lt; 0 do </p>

<p>whatever it is you do.</p>

<h3 id="uptodownto">upto/downto</h3>
<p>You’ll notice that in some of the examples above I used two periods and in some three. When three periods are in play, the loop goes up to but does not include the final indicator. In the same way, “upto” and “downto” take us ride up to the brink of our limits. </p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>100.downto(0) do</td>
      <td>i</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>or</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1.upto(200) do</td>
      <td>i</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Don’t forget your “end”.</p>

<h3 id="each">each</h3>
<p>Then there are those single-word methods that do all the work of what we have in the above examples. See the Enumerable mixin for a comprehensive list of specialized looping. Perhaps the most useful is the self-explanatory #each:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>array.each do</td>
      <td>i</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Let me know if I’ve missed any!</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <h2 id="the-tech-shuttle-debate">The Tech Shuttle Debate</h2>

<p>San Francisco was once a sanctuary for just about anyone, but now the city is commonly referred to as a “homogenized college campus.” Unfortunately, the change isn’t just a cosmetic one but also one driven by spikes in evictions, homelessness, and economic disparity.  That’s way too much for one blog post, but there’s one thing that’s become a symbol of all the turmoil: the tech shuttle buses.</p>

<p>These charters are what many tech critics have decided to fixate upon, a tangible symbol that can be personally accessed and addressed.  But what’s the big deal? Buses are good, right? they’re argued to cut down on pollution and reduce road congestion. Many of the tech giants are using them now to haul a city-wide average of 35,000 boarders a day to jobs south in Silicon Valley.  Google and others tout their buses as the cleanest diesel vehicles available. The rides are considered a company perk and are equipped with wifi and baristas, and they’re not just vehicles of transportation; they’re also vehicles that foster a massive economic boom in the Bay Area.</p>

<p>The buses have cut something deeper than their routes across the city’s network of streets though.  In his beautiful and interactive <a href="#picspace">“Clusters of Affluence”</a> map, data-journalist, Chris Walker, shows how property values have spiked along the various bus routes.  The flip side of this is that evictions have also spiked. Landlords know they can double and sometimes triple the price of a rental and still have no problem renting it. It’s common in my neighborhood to show up at an open house for a rental and be met with competition offering a full year’s rent in cash, and evictions are the highest in a decade. Of course, properties along the bus routes have the strongest draw as well as some of the highest prices. </p>

<p>So, for each car commute a shuttle bus eliminates, it potentially creates several more in displaced workers who are forced to move and commute back IN to the city for their job.  The environmental argument for the shuttles grows weaker.</p>

<p>Another problem with the shuttles is their unwarranted use of city resources. They often park in MUNI bus stops while city buses wait in the street, paying city bus riders wait for tech employees to load, and the already horrendous traffic backs up even further.</p>

  <figcaption><a href="http://stamen.com/" title="Stamen Design has a bunch of amazing maps.">Stamen Design has a bunch of amazing maps, and they took the tech bus routes as inspiration for this one</a>.</figcaption>


 
So, what's the solution? Some critics have taken to protesting: slashing bus tires, breaking windows, blocking the street, and even vomiting on the vehicles. While protesting is a great way to get the conversation started and heard, as one bus employee said, it also involves "misplaced hostility" and no long-term solution. Alternatively (and in response), the City of San Francisco pushed a pilot program through that would <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/02/us-usa-tech-lawsuit-idUSBREA410Z720140502">charge tech companies $3.55</a> per stop per day to use city bus stops, among other mandates. This makes sense but also just "pays" for something that isn't really changing. I think a better solution would be for tech companies to partner with San Francisco, San Mateo, and Santa Clara counties to extend the BART line from SFO to Silicon Valley. There's already a BART project underway to reach Silicon Valley from the East Bay, so why not implement it on the SF side as well? That way, tech companies are giving back to the Bay Area while supporting their own workers and cutting their commutes.  It would induce an integration: tech employees would commute with the people in the Bay Area rather than above them in, as writer <a href="http://www.guernicamag.com/daily/rebecca-solnit-resisting-monoculture/">Rebecca Solnit</a> describes the charter buses, "a cross between a limousine and an armored personnel carrier."
