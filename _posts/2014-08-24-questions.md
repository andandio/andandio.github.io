##How to Ask a Good Question

This is a great topic to write about because, historically, I've been a pretty terrible question asker. For a long time, I allowed myself to believe that asking questions (to another person) somehow indicates a kind of weakness, so I didn't practice it much. 

I'm a much better question asker on the Internet, probably because the best asked questions of search engines are those asked in caveman syntax. The fewer, more important words, the better. Talking with real live people involves a higher, more sophisticated synthesis of nonverbal cues, body language, eye contact, preparation, and articulation. 

So, now I look to the Internet for help with asking questions of other humans. Here's what the Internet answers:

###Know what you're Looking for.

A good question has an end in site; it's not characterized by a "please tell me the history of the world" sort of open-endedness. It's as precise as it hopes its answer to be. That said, don't ask yes or no questions. Maybe thinking like a reporter would be a good goal for this one. Ask for nouns and verbs, very specific ones.

###Use Follow Up Questions.

Learning to code has definitely honed my skills in this area. Rarely, have I had my questions answered in a single response regarding coding. I've learned that I have to take the pieces that come to me and look further down the road toward where they point. There's a certain endurance involved with follow-up questions that I was complete wimp at before I started coding. Coding has taught me (across all topics) to ask early, ask often, ask again, rephrase, ask more. 

###Accepting the Response.

There's power in silence, especially when it's being used to formulate an accurate exchange. When a question is asked, it's good to give the asked a chance to answer. Not interupting would definitely be filed here too. Even if, in asking the question, the answer comes automatically, it's good to hold out for the person asked; they might have an even greater answer in store.

###Ask the Right Person.
My girlfriend answers and asks questions for a living, so I thought I'd ask her what she would say is most important about asking questions. I was expecting her focus to be like mine, to be something that the asker does to prepare their statement. Her answer, however, had more to do with the person who's being asked. She said she thinks it's important to make sure the person addressed is receptive to being engaged, to read their body language before asking the question, and to know your source.The Internet agrees. You don't want to ask a four-year old for instructions on turning off your gas main. Know who you're talking to and adress an appropriate person for the topic.
