##The Tech Shuttle Debate

San Francisco was once a sanctuary for just about anyone, but now the city is commonly referred to as a "homogenized college campus." Unfortunately, the change isn't just a cosmetic one but also one driven by spikes in evictions, homelessness, and economic disparity.  That's way too much for one blog post, but there's one thing that's become a symbol of all the turmoil: the tech shuttle buses.

These charters are what many tech critics have decided to fixate upon, a tangible symbol that can be personally accessed and addressed.  But what's the big deal? Buses are good, right? they're argued to cut down on pollution and reduce road congestion. Many of the tech giants are using them now to haul a city-wide average of 35,000 boarders a day to jobs south in Silicon Valley.  Google and others tout their buses as the cleanest diesel vehicles available. The rides are considered a company perk and are equipped with wifi and baristas, and they're not just vehicles of transportation; they're also vehicles that foster a massive economic boom in the Bay Area.

The buses have cut something deeper than their routes across the city's network of streets though.  In his beautiful and interactive <a href = "#picspace">"Clusters of Affluence"</a> map, data-journalist, Chris Walker, shows how property values have spiked along the various bus routes.  The flip side of this is that evictions have also spiked. Landlords know they can double and sometimes triple the price of a rental and still have no problem renting it. It's common in my neighborhood to show up at an open house for a rental and be met with competition offering a full year's rent in cash, and evictions are the highest in a decade. Of course, properties along the bus routes have the strongest draw as well as some of the highest prices. 

So, for each car commute a shuttle bus eliminates, it potentially creates several more in displaced workers who are forced to move and commute back IN to the city for their job.  The environmental argument for the shuttles grows weaker.

Another problem with the shuttles is their unwarranted use of city resources. They often park in MUNI bus stops while city buses wait in the street, paying city bus riders wait for tech employees to load, and the already horrendous traffic backs up even further.

So, what's the solution? Some critics have taken to protesting: slashing bus tires, breaking windows, blocking the street, and even vomiting on the vehicles. While protesting is a great way to get the conversation started and heard, as one bus employee said, it also involves "misplaced hostility" and no long-term solution. Alternatively (and in response), the City of San Francisco pushed a pilot program through that would <a href = "http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/02/us-usa-tech-lawsuit-idUSBREA410Z720140502">charge tech companies $3.55</a> per stop per day to use city bus stops, among other mandates. This makes sense but also just "pays" for something that isn't really changing. I think a better solution would be for tech companies to partner with San Francisco, San Mateo, and Santa Clara counties to extend the BART line from SFO to Silicon Valley. There's already a BART project underway to reach Silicon Valley from the East Bay, so why not implement it on the SF side as well? That way, tech companies are giving back to the Bay Area while supporting their own workers and cutting their commutes.  It would induce an integration: tech employees would commute with the people in the Bay Area rather than above them in, as writer <a href = "http://www.guernicamag.com/daily/rebecca-solnit-resisting-monoculture/">Rebecca Solnit</a> describes the charter buses, "a cross between a limousine and an armored personnel carrier."
