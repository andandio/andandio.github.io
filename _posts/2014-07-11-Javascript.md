###Why Javascript?

Javascript was created in just 10 days. It's unique in that way as most languages have an incubation time in a lab where much troubleshooting and bug-fixing occurs. Javascript did not. It came out like a quick and dynamic but untrained boxer, flashy and competent but riddled with flaws; and as a result, it took many years and <a href= "https://www.w3.org/community/webed/wiki/A_Short_History_of_JavaScript">many shots</a> to become the favored contender that it is today.

It was created by Brendan Eich, and today It's a trademark of the Oracle Corporation; but like that ambitious and restless boxer, Javascript has been funneled through a labyrinth of gyms and trainers on its way up. It's been layered with capabilities and components as a result.

It was born in 1995, but its upward momentum was somewhat thwarted by <a href="http://webaim.org/blog/user-agent-string-history/">the great browser wars</a> of the late 90's and early millenium. It did appreciate with some cyclical standardization, and then in 2005, Javascript got a major foothold. A guy named Jesse James Garret released a series of technologies for which Javascript was the backbone. Its relevancy went suddenly and exponentially fertile.

Needless to say, it hasn't always been loved by all, and It's not all to be loved. After all, it hasn't shed all those nasty habits from its street-fighting days. One JS expert, <a href = "http://it-ebooks.info/book/274/">Douglas Crockford</a> had this to say about the language in its totality:

> some of those features were more trouble than they were worth. Some of them were poorly specified... more likely to cause portability problems. Some resulted in code that was difficult ot read or modify. Some induced me to write in a manner that was too tricky and error-prone. And some of those features were design errors. Sometimes language designers make mistakes.

Today, Javascript continues to grow in dynamism and power. When learning it, It's important to focus on what it does well. So, why use it? The reasons are multifold: 
  <ul>
     <li>It's easy to learn.</li>
     <li>It's simple and accessible to edit. You don't need any fancy software to make it happen.</li>
     <li>It makes use of prototyping. Any object can be created for any situation, and they all inherit properties of the object protoype. This allows for a ton of flexibility.</li>
     <li>Web development tools are set up to use Javascript. this = simplicity.</li>
     <li>Ajax. This is what makes Javascript work without a page reload.</li>
     <li>HTML5 is like Javascript's longtime sparring partner; they've been designed to understand one another.</li>
     <li>It's <a href = "http://nodejs.org/">ever-evolving</a>.</li>
   </ul>
