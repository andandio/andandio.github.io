## The Exponential Learning in Peer Pairing

I have peer pairing anxiety.

Whenever the hour comes, and Google sends me that dreaded message that it's almost time to put on my headphones and talk to a stranger through my computer screen, it's not excitement that I feel. I start sweating.  A lot. In fact, the other day, my girlfriend asked me why I was wearing a wet t-shirt. 

"I just got done with a peer pairing,"" I responded. 

I love solitude, and when I started learning and loving to write code, I thought, yes, I finally have an excuse to spend all the time in the world inside my own head. Well, now it turns out that working with another person and, more importantly, being able to articulate my thoughts to a peer on a project are some of the most important skills I can develop in this apprenticeship-like program at DBC. The anxiety around pairing is simply a pointer toward where I can develop myself, so I guess I'm starting to appreciate it as such.

I also wasn't expecting the goldmine that peer pairing turns out to be. My learning has grown exponentially from peer pairing. I've had the realization that while the rate at which I learn independently might generate competence, the rate at which I learn from others has the potential to create excellence. Learning tricks from everyone = way more tricks.

So, I'm really into it even though it makes me uncomfortable. 

The coupling of peer pairing and the feedback system seems like a biceps/triceps kind of relationship. Without one, the strength of the other would be far less pronounced. Feedback has had the effect of controlling my momentum in order that I don't punch myself in the face, so to speak. Also, I feel like if I only received feedback on the work I did, I'd have no opportunity to address the way my thought processes restrict the flexibility of my thinking.

I like the fact that it's anonymous, or pseudo-anonymous. (It's not that difficult to figure out who said what.) Not everyone can say exactly what they're thinking in person, and not everyone knows exactly what they think about an interaction until they've had time to think about it. In general, it seems like the percent honesty goes way up when there's an option to write an anonymous note. For me, I like to go back to working independently after a peer session and see just how a pairing has impacted my thinking before I give feedback. 
 

Someone left me a piece of feedback the other day suggesting that I develop myself in this one particular way. I felt a range of emotions that came with thoughts like "inadequate" and "incompetent". But then my competitive side took over, and I thought, no way am I going to get that feedback again, and so I spent an hour or so researching and practicing the suggestion.  What happened was inexplicable:  everything changed, even things seemingly unrelated. The way I approached challenges, even the way I thought about pseudocode, was totally different than it had been before. The feedback wasn't about skill; it was just about the taking of steps. It made such a weird, huge difference that I'm really grateful for it and have since been hoping for more of the actionable stuff.
