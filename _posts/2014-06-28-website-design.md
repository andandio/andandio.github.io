###Pitchfork.tv

I've been a longtime visitor to Pitchfork for the music. It's consistently a great place to find new music, but only recently has it also become a better site to be on as well. It used to be kind of a mess, with unclear navigation and a disorganized collage. The newer version is perfectly set up for what the site is best for: discovering music. It's still not the greatest looking site in my opinion. I'm not a huge fan of the all-black background and overall heaviness. I like it's use of the gallery a lot though; it streamlines and seems to set everything equally so the user's eye can be drawn toward the aesthetic that tends to match individual musical preference. The featured video is obviously where the eye is immediately drawn, which creates a powerful minimalism for the front page (and other pages too), is ever-changing and, as a result, an attraction. The site also does a great job of understating the excessive numbers of pages it contains with the gray tabs and tiny font. I generally walk away from Pitchfork having found something new,  and feeling like there's a lot of great music in the world and not enough time to enjoy all of it.

###Scribd.

Scribd. calls itself the Netflix of books, and it's getting closer to living up to that title. When I first started using the site, it was a cluttered collection of academic papers with a million ads, but it's successfully evolved into something definitely more elegant and definitely more Netflixesque. It bookmarks where a user's at with each item viewed, and it gives some excellent suggestions based on past reads. I continue to find stuff on there that I haven't found anywhere else online alongside bestsellers. Unfortunately, it's a paid site, so when you first get there, you get asked for money or a free month trial. Had I not enjoyed its perks when it was free, this would be a deal breaker. Once logged in, my attention is usually pulled into the recommendation sections, and if I don't get sucked into one of these,  then I end up circling up toward the icons that show where I left off in past reads. I like that it's equally easy to get lost down a trail of suggestions as it is to search its trove for obscure papers on whatever. I generally leave the site feeling inspired.

###Ubuweb

Ubuweb is compact, dense, content heavy, and intense. I love it because it manages to maintain minimilism in an unorthodox sort of way. It uses incredibly tiny font and a lot of white space. The top header on each page is usually cryptic and creepy and, like the rest of the design, doesn't take away from the content. The site is very light on design which lets the content stand out. And the content is really remarkable. It's a giant archive of rarely found audio material, poetry, and some visual representations as well. It's a unique site, one that took me more than one visit to fall in love with. The design makes it feel like mining for a treasure rather than being handed one.
