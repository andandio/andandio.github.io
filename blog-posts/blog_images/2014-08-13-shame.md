###Conflict and the Shame Spin

Looking at the four points on the compass of shame diagram, I realized that the concept of the "shame-spiral", where feeling shame about behavior, followed by more shame-inducing behavior, is a lot like losing one's sense of direction. The more panicked a person feels about being lost, the more lost they are likely to become.
      

I recently had a conflict arise with someone I cross paths with almost every day. A coworker kept talking to me about his some of his core beliefs, and his comments, while not explicitly bigoted, hinted that the speaker believed his own moral position to be above most others. Before I responded to him, I took some time to think about what it was that I was responding to. Historically, I've gotten along very well with this guy. While he was talking, I had the impulse to argue with him in a manner that would come closest to the "Attack Other" side of the compass.

Upon reflection, I have to say that this impulse to attack (with words) was a hair-trigger response stemming from a strong desire not to feel shame. My father was a pastor in the same religion as this coworker and an argument with him was most certainly a response to the shame I felt as a younger person under the guidance of this type of teaching. That kind of shame heightened, grew unbearable even, before I became the person that I am today. I lived for a long time bouncing between the corners of "Attacking Self" and "Avoidance", between camouflaging the shame and full-on self-destruction. 

These days, I feel very little shame in comparison to what that former me experienced, and I feel shame in ways much more proportionate to actual mistakes made; shame doesn't overwhelm me like it once did. In this situation with my coworker, however, it was difficult to distinguish between the residual shame this interaction triggered in me and straight-up outrage at what I consider to be at the root of much classist, racist, and homophobic thinking.

Ultimately, my response may have fallen dangerously close to the "attack" corner of the compass. When my coworker flippantly called himself a peaceful person, I shot back that I'd heard he'd done a lot of gay bashing in his youth. His response was really remarkable. He came back in a way that shocked me more than anything else could have. He performed a sort of confessional in which he described in great detail and with great sorrow a moment in time when he and a friend had broken all the windows out of a gay man's house in the Castro in the mid 80's. It was a story that would normally have been very upsetting, but his remorse and humility were so evident that what I heard the loudest was an example of how to handle both mistakes of the past as well as conflicts in the present.
