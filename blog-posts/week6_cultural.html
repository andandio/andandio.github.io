      <h3>Stereotype Threat</h3>

<p>Listening to Dr. Claude Steele deliver his data on stereotype threat sent a line of a famous Romantic poet shooting through my mind. I had to go look it up to remember it exactly, but it ended up being a line from William Wordsworth from a poem with a title too long and too boring to include here. The line though, is a telling one; it goes: "...of eye, and ear, --both what they half create, /and what perceive;... "</p>

<p>Snooze, you might be thinking. But, wait, the point is not to lull you to sleep with iambic pentameter before the good part of this blog. It's to suggest that human wiring for reality is and has been for a long time an entwined mess of the projected self and the perceived self.  Everyone has some ratio of it; we half create and half perceive (not usually a 50/50 split). No one is fully in control of how they come across in the world. Unfortunately, as a result we get stereotyped.  We get lumped together. We get something else that came out of Wordsworth's era, a category and a label.</p>

<p>It was really fascinating to hear what Steele's studies uncovered about the impact of identity threat. There seems to be a wild paradox in his data: an individual ends up gripping (or being gripped by) an identity that is under threat. Someone who is the only one of something in a room feels the weight of that identity more, and the stereotype can become relevant in the mind of that individual to the point that they fear reinforcing it. The fact that this can lead to failure and subpar performance is testament to the complexity of the human mind. The part of the individual that threatens them the most is that which they are both more likely to protect and that they also want to set free from oppressive societal misconceptions. In essence, under pressure we can end up taking on other's perceptions of us in an attempt to escape other's perceptions of us. </p>

<p>The outcome of his research consistently spanned many different race and gender groups. Stereotype threat is a very real and powerful thing that, while always uncomfortable, seems to be exponentially powerful under the push of heavy loads of prejudice and discrimination. </p> 

<p>So how to address these threats in the workplace, especially in a sector so notoriously intent on homogeneity? I think it's important to be vocal and respectful and to also give people the space to feel uncomfortable. Talking to people and being vulnerable is a great start. </p>

<p>Stereotype threat has impacted me in powerful ways, but I don't think focusing on what threatens my identity as a straight, white male is an important focus. I think for people like me, who don't visibly reside in marginalized territory, it's more important to focus on identifying those stereotypes, fueled by prejudice and discrimination, which have benefitted me at the expense of others. I feel like these, marked by language and attitude, are the pressure points at which real change can be exacted. </p>
