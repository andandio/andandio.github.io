  	<div id = "txtbrick"><p>I feel honored to be part of an educational experiment like Dev Boocamp. The day I started Phase 0, Dev announced their acquisition by Kaplan. To me this signals that DBC has brought their experiment with learning and teaching to a pinnacle that the rest of the world is interested in tapping. That's an exciting place and time to be stepping into. That said, I'm pretty terrified. This program seems to ask not just for a ton of learning, but for a change in the way I think about learning: a huge and humbling change to undertake. <br> <br> One of the most invigorating takeaways from the fireside video was Shereef's description of the "creator" versus the "entitlement" mindset. It seems lke traditional education models definitely reinforce the entitlement mode of being. I have a Master's, and I know from spending large amounts of time with them that the academics' mindset can definitely foster entitlement and that "restaurant" attitude. I'm thrilled to be walking into an alternative to that. The "kitchen" perspective is definitely a way of thinking that I'd like to be able to contribute to both my job and my personal life.
