  	<article id = "txtbrick"><p>In retrospect, my two dominant thinking styles are pretty clearly demarcated. In the past I've attributed this to being a Gemini, so I'm glad to finally have a more academically-reinforced reason for my volatility. I'd say I've tended mostly to volley between the two, but seeing them laid out all table-bound, I'm realizing the potential in synthesizing them as well.</p> 

<p>I'm a close split between Concrete Random and Abstract Sequential, which by definition, includes both polarity as well as some crossover. I like experimenting and using my intuition as much as I like to analyze and apply logic. Sometimes this pairing has proven contradictory or mutually exclusive, and at other times, it's been alchemical. I do like to jump into something head-first, sometimes before I fully understand it; but I'm also incredibly uncomfortable with this inclination and will often pull back and try to force out a plan of action. I like trial and error as much as I like access to and info from more informed mentors, and I thrive on competition just as much as I like to work in complete isolation for days on end.</p> 

<p>What I've gathered about my learning from this look at my two styles is that I need to be careful about one style canceling out the vitality of the other. I know when I get fascist about a plan of action, my Abstract Sequential self wants the disruptive, risk-taking Concrete Random self to stick to the logic. I also know that the CR will trial and error himself into a frenzy while the AS is happy to ask for some guidance or to consult a tutorial.</p>  

<p>I think it would behoove me to allow a little more dialogue between these two: to lean toward their collaboration rather than their conflict. I think it boils down to change and agility. There's a huge potential benefit from having different styles and outlets. Allowing myself to change things up, to pull in a player off the bench, to mix and match, to let one style take precedence when a situation calls for it, and to avoid defaulting to habit could all really improve my learning and my efficiency. This is where my <a href = "http://mindsetonline.com/changeyourmindset/firststeps/">mindset</a> must come into play. The contradiction that arises from these two learning styles has been largely a result of a fixed mindset, of a first thought is last chance kind of rationalizing. With the development of a more sophisticated growth mindset, I think my two learning styles can be integrated and mutually beneficial rather than primarily adverse.</p> 

<p>Also, I'm trying to pay close attention to where these two styles cross over. It seems they both thrive on working through problems alone, so I have to continue to give myself ample solitude to really synthesize the concepts I'm learning. Both styles also have a tough time with too much routine and rule restrictions. Keeping a regimen that allows for innovation and exploration will be one of my greatest challenges, but it should also prove to be very rewarding. </p>
