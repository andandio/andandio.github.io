<h1>WireFrames</h1>

<p>Pitchfork. This wireframe shows the site navigation panel and the music and event link panel at the top of the pitchfork page. This is a real eye-opener in design regards. The obstacle here is the quantity of links they have to set up. It's almost too many, but this design gives a kind of cascade effect from heavier to longer and thinner. It organizes the user's experience (and being alphabetized doesn't hurt either).</p>
<img src="images/Scribdwire1.jpg.png" alt="scribd wire">
<p>Scribd. Scribd wants to show a user a lot of content and a lot of options. This wireframe shows how the horizontal headers act as gutter bumpers of a sort. They keep the reader looking down specific avenues rather than all possible routes at once. This keep the user focused on one of a plethora of suggestions.</p>
<img src="images/ubuwebwire.jpg.png" alt="ubuweb wire">
<p>Ubuweb. The challenge again, to an even greater degree, is quantity of content. The method here seems to be tight, straight lines. I can see why they used the many-columned approach, sort of like a newspaper. Anything else would probably be a mess. The shorter columns make reading the tiny font possible and afford more content and more white space to the page.</p>
