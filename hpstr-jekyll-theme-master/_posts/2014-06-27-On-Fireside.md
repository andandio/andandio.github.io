## Thoughts on Fireside

I feel honored to be part of an educational experiment like Dev Boocamp. The day I started Phase 0, Dev announced their acquisition by Kaplan. To me this signals that DBC has brought their experiment with learning and teaching to a pinnacle that that has peaked the interest of scholars and others invested in the learning process worldwide. That's an exciting place and time in which to be joining. That said, I'm pretty terrified. This program seems to ask not just for a ton of learning, but for a change in the way I think about learning: a huge and humbling change to undertake. 

One of the most invigorating takeaways from the fireside video was Shereef's description of the "creator" versus the "entitlement" mindset. It seems like traditional education models definitely reinforce the entitlement mode of being. I have a Master's degree, and I know from spending large amounts of time with them that the academics' mindset can definitely foster entitlement and that "restaurant" attitude. I'm thrilled to be walking into an alternative to that. The "kitchen" perspective is definitely a mode of engagement that I'd like to be able to contribute to both my job and my personal life.
