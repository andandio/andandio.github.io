###Abstract Sequential Meets Concrete Random

In retrospect, my two dominant thinking styles are pretty clearly demarcated. In the past I've attributed this to being a Gemini, so I'm glad to finally have a more academically-reinforced reason for my volatility. I'd say I've tended mostly to volley between the two, but seeing them laid out all table-bound, I'm realizing the potential in synthesizing them as well.

I'm a close split between Concrete Random and Abstract Sequential, which by definition, includes both polarity as well as some crossover. I like experimenting and using my intuition as much as I like to analyze and apply logic. Sometimes this pairing has proven contradictory or mutually exclusive, and at other times, it's been alchemical. I do like to jump into something head-first, sometimes before I fully understand it; but I'm also incredibly uncomfortable with this inclination and will often pull back and try to force out a plan of action. I like trial and error as much as I like access to and info from more informed mentors, and I thrive on competition just as much as I like to work in complete isolation for days on end.

What I've gathered about my learning from this look at my two styles is that I need to be careful about one style canceling out the vitality of the other. I know when I get fascist about a plan of action, my Abstract Sequential self wants the disruptive, risk-taking Concrete Random self to stick to the logic. I also know that the CR will trial and error himself into a frenzy while the AS is happy to ask for some guidance or to consult a tutorial.

I think it would behoove me to allow a little more dialogue between these two: to lean toward their collaboration rather than their conflict. I think it boils down to change and agility. There's a huge potential benefit from having different styles and outlets. Allowing myself to change things up, to pull in a player off the bench, to mix and match, to let one style take precedence when a situation calls for it, and to avoid defaulting to habit could all really improve my learning and my efficiency. This is where my <a href = "http://mindsetonline.com/changeyourmindset/firststeps/">mindset</a> must come into play. The contradiction that arises from these two learning styles has been largely a result of a fixed mindset, of a first thought is last chance kind of rationalizing. With the development of a more sophisticated growth mindset, I think my two learning styles can be integrated and mutually beneficial rather than primarily adverse.

Also, I'm trying to pay close attention to where these two styles cross over. It seems they both thrive on working through problems alone, so I have to continue to give myself ample solitude to really synthesize the concepts I'm learning. Both styles also have a tough time with too much routine and rule restrictions. Keeping a regimen that allows for innovation and exploration will be one of my greatest challenges, but it should also prove to be very rewarding.
