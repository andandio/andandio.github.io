###Statically Typed versus Dynamically Typed, how Languages Shift

The primary difference between static and dynamic computer languages is that in static languages, a variable must be declared as a type before it can be used in the code. These types include String, integer, float, array, etc. In a dynamic language, once the type is determined, the variable cannot change into something else (except with parsing and a few other tricks), and it must abide by the rules its type determines.

The line of judement occurs when the code is compiled. In statically typed languages, this can be helpful because bugs can be located and squashed earlier. In Dynamic languages, errors don't pop up until run time, and can as a result, be a little trickier to try to unpack.  

One thing that can help developers who work in Dynamic languages is the implementation of test code to find those bugs earlier while still enjoying the freedom of not having to declare a variable type for every variable instantiation.  

So, what is Ruby? Ruby is a dynamically typed language because you can change the variable type within a program, and you don't have to determine what kind of variable you're initiating.
 
It's easy to confuse the terms strongly and weakly typed languages with dynamic and static. Don't be fooled; they aren't the same even though they're very similar. Although strong and static have some crossover, Ruby is actually both a dynamically and a strongly typed language. These might seem like opposites, but they really aren't. The trick is that once a program knows what type it's dealing with, it wants its methods to match it. That's what makes Ruby strongly typed. Javascript is another dynamically typed language, but it happens to be also characterized as weakly typed. You can mix and match types in expressions as well as swap their type out whenever you want.
